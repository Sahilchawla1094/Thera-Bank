# Thera-Bank

Data Description:

The given file contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic
information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage,
securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign
(Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal
loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.

Domain: Banking

Context:

This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of
converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as
depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy
conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to
devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal
budget.

Objective:

The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.
Steps and tasks:
1. Read the column description and ensure you understand each
attribute well 2. Study the data distribution in each attribute, share your
findings
3. Get the target column distribution. Your comments
4. Split the data into training and test set in the ratio of 70:30 respectively
5. Use Neural networks to predict the likelihood of a customer buying personal loans
